# Ambient Display

Personal project for using an unused, old iPad to have an ambient but useful display.

## Motivation

I found myself constantly checking the weather everytime I was getting ready and leaving the house. I needed to know if I needed to wear a coat or grab an umbrella. I was using my iPhone or Apple watch but that took a few steps even when I had those with me. Couldn't the information just be there all the time?

## Target platform

Apple iPad mini 2, Retina display

## Features

- Shows current date/time
- Shows current weather with icons
- Shows today's schedule, and in the evening, tomorrow's.

## Future work

- Add a todo list/shopping list
- Show hourly temp/weather
- Washing machine timer
- Allow adding shopping list items via Siri
- Port to Apple TV (hopefully someday tvOS will support 3rd party screensavers)
- Aesthetic design (might never happen...)
